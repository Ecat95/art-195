<p>
 In my works there is a theme of poking at reality/everyday life though a fantastical world. The works are currently use blender, and after-effects as the main programs in use. I am interested in continuing and building on the unreality of my works.
  <br>The 3D figures are made in blender. The controllable land of the project that holds everything and lets the viewer move is A-Frame. The A-Frame lets everything be laid out for the viewer to look around. The viewer can go left or right from the starting point and see a few of the outdoor dangers in a space.
